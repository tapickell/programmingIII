*** Welcome to the Awesome Grocery Inventory System ***

-This program is creating an object for each line. All fields need to be input for
each inventory item. The item number field must be greater than 1000. The necessary entries will include the following items: Item Number, Item Name, Wholesale Price, Number on Hand, Max Number, Vendor, Order Level, Retail Price, and Department. The users will be instructed on the
procedure for exiting the program. The users will have a help file available that
will list the instructions if needed.
