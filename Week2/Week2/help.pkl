Thank you for using the .pkl file appender.

this is by far the least advanced text editor you
have ever used. it has less features then notepad.
you would be much better off to use nano, vim or even emacs.

What you can do:
write multiple lines of text out to a .pkl file.
then view the lines you wrote with a line count.
thats it.
nothing else, really.

What you can't do:
open other .pkl files
save multiple files.
delete file contents.
overwrite file contents.
edit previous contents.
anything else you would expect to do with a text editor.

enjoy :P
